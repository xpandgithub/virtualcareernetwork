SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

The VCN distribution is intended to be used in conjunction with Drupal 7, and assumes expertise in this.  The "drupal" distribution should be installed within Drupal 7, and has been tested and deployed with Drupal 7.20, available here:

https://drupal.org/drupal-7.20-release-notes 

The theme installation requires the Stark theme, available at Drupal.org.  The included custom theme "vcnstark" is a sub-theme of Stark.
