	Dear Academic Advisor:<br /><br />
	
	I am requesting academic credit toward my intended degree program based
	on my prior learning. Please find attached my "Learning Inventory", a
	comprehensive list of my prior learning, including:
	<ul>
		<li>Military Training</li>
		<li>Professional Training</li>
		<li>National Examinations</li>
		<li>Previously completed college course</li>
	</ul>
	The American Council on Education (ACE) has provided credit
	recommendations for the prior learning I obtained through military
	training, national examinations, and other professional training.<br /><br />
	
	I would greatly appreciate your review of the enclosed Learning
	Inventory to determine if my prior learning might apply toward my
	intended degree program. I understand this institution and my degree
	program will determine how my prior learning can be applied toward a
	degree. I will provide additional details and official transcripts as
	needed.<br /><br />
	
	I produced this report using the Virtual Career Network, www.vcn.org.<br /><br />
	Thank you for your time and consideration.<br /><br /><br />
	
	Sincerely,<br />
	<?php echo $name;?><br />
